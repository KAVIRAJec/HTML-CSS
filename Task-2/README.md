## Workflow

### 1. **HTML Structure**
- Created a card component in `index.html`:
  - `<container>`: Contains the list of card, aligns them.
  - `<div class="card">`: Contains an image, title, and description.
  - `<img>`: Displays the card image.
  - `<h3>`: Displays the card title.
  - `<p>`: Displays the card description.

### 2. **CSS Styling**
- Styled the card in `styles.css`:
  - **Card Styling**:
    - Added a border, shadow, and padding for a clean layout.
    - Rounded the corners using `border-radius`.
  - **Hover Effect**:
    - Used `transform: scale(1.05)` to enlarge the card slightly on hover.
    - Changed the background color on hover.
    - Applied `transition` for smooth scaling and color changes.
  - **Responsive Design**:
    - Used a media query to adjust the layout for screens smaller than 600px.
    - Stacked cards vertically and adjusted their width for smaller screens.
