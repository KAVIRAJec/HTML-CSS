## Workflow

### 1. **HTML Structure**

  - `<div class="grid-item">`: Individual items in the grid.

### 2. **CSS Styling**
- Styled the grid in `styles.css`:
  - **Grid Layout**:
    - Used `grid-template-columns` to define the number of columns.
    - Added `gap` for consistent spacing between items.
  - **Responsive Design**:
    - Used media queries to adjust the number of columns based on screen width.
  - **Hover Effect**:
    - Applied `transform: scale(1.05)` to enlarge items slightly on hover.
